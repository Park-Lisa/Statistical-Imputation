# Statistical-Imputation

**Task Specific Imputation Method**

Imputation is necessary because it is difficult to analyze data with missing values. So I learned multivariate imputation by chained equations method to impute missing values and analyzed the results in class. The result analysis was mostly focused on seeing plots of imputed data to check the bias. However, there are many kinds of tasks that I could do with one imputed data. For instance, with consumers' consumption data I would be able to predict the amount of their consumption or whether they are buying or not. I was wondering if one imputed data would be appropriate for all tasks if these various tasks were created. So, I would like to know if a kind of greedy solution is a global solution. I planned this project to solve these questions. I would like to apply several imputation methods which have different algorithms on the missing data and compare their performance when the each imputed data are used in regression and classification tasks.
